    About half of this course hinges around a general understanding of probability theory and some essential
    statistical tools such as MLEs and Confidence Intervals.Although most of the materials in this course are
    self-contained and usually do a retouch on these fundamental concepts, it is highly suggested that students
    who take this course, already have a strong background in both probability and statistics.

      There are a number of excellent courses available online covering these topics. A skim through the material or
      lectures of such courses might be a perfect way to review and fill in the gaps of your probabilistic and
      statistical knowledge!

      The following two courses from [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/){: description="Massive repository of free MIT courses" kind="Course Repository" },
      are a great start:

          description: A thorough course that covers probability theory from axioms up until basic Markov
            Chains and Markov Decision Processes. Instructed by the great Prof. John Tsitsiklis, auditing this course is
            highly suggested for those students who feel uncomfortable with general probability theory.

          text: A First Course in Probability, by Sheldon M. Ross
          description: features clear and intuitive explanations of the mathematics of probability theory, outstanding
            problem sets, and a variety of diverse examples and applications. This book only assumes a background in
            elementary calculus.

          text: "All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, by Larry Wasserman"
          description: This book covers a much wider range of topics than a typical introductory text on mathematical
            statistics. It includes modern topics like nonparametric curve estimation, bootstrapping and classification,
            topics that are usually relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is assumed to know calculus and a little
            linear algebra.
