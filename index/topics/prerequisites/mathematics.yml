    One can argue that Artificial Intelligence is nothing but pure mathematics! The more math you know, the easier studying this course and any other 
    engineering course would be for you. No significant background in mathematics is necessary for taking this course, but students are expected to be 
    familiar with basic Calculus. In addition, knowing some Linear Algebra is a plus.
